# User Journeys

User journey artifacts map end-to-end user experiences, capturing personas, stages, pain points, and opportunities.

Each journey is a folder containing:
- A titled markdown file `(JOURNEY-NNN)-Title.md` as the primary artifact
- An embedded Mermaid `journey` diagram visualizing the stages and pain points
- Optional supporting documents
