# Vision Documents

Product vision artifacts define the high-level direction, value proposition, and phased delivery strategy for the product.

Each vision is a folder containing:
- A titled markdown file `(VISION-NNN)-Title.md` as the primary artifact
- Supporting documents (architecture overview, competitive analysis, roadmap, etc.)
